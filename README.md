Purpose:
This project is meant to take comic2pdf and essentially make it usable using a GUI rather than simply as terminal or command line based program.

This would make the program much more friendly for users who do not want to configure python or mess with a make-file.

The script is converted to a .exe via auto-py-to-exe which is found here:
